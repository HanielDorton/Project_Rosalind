My Project Rosalind Solutions
=============================

I attempted many Project Rosalilnd problems in order to get better at problem solving algorithms using Python. In this repository,
I have collected a few of my favourite solutions. Project Rosalind is a site very similar to Project Euler except instead of math, the problems
all center around biology. Also, unlike Euler, the problem/solution isn't static: when you are ready, you click a button, download a dataset 
and have five minutes to upload the solution. Because of the more concerete nature of the problems and the dynamic datasets, I enjoyed this site
a lot more than Euler and ended up spending a lot more time here.
